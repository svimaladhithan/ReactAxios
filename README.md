This repo is about simple CRUD operation.
I have created a API using mockAPI and used postman application for the verification purposes
I have used Axios for the API fetch all over the project and performed a CRUD operation
In the create page, you can add a new user which will be added to the API
In the edit page, a form will be shown with the details of the user when we click on edit in the usrs page, once we edit the data and click update, the changes will be updated to the respective ID
Home page will populate all the users information from the API
Users page will have the users data in the table and have the edit and delete buttons
